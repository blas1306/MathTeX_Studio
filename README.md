# MathTeX Studio

> A math-first computational environment for technical writing, numerical computation, and executable scientific documents.

MathTeX Studio combines the workflow of LaTeX, MATLAB/Octave, Jupyter, and scientific computing tools into a single environment focused on mathematical and technical work.

Instead of separating:

- computation
- plotting
- symbolic manipulation
- report writing
- PDF generation

into multiple disconnected applications, MathTeX Studio allows everything to happen inside one integrated workflow.

# Why MathTeX Studio?

In a traditional workflow, a student or researcher often needs to:

1. Compute results in MATLAB, Octave, Python, or Julia
2. Generate plots separately
3. Export tables manually
4. Copy results into LaTeX
5. Recompile the document every time something changes

MathTeX Studio was created to remove that friction.

The idea is simple:

> write the computation and the document together

When values, equations, tables, or plots change, the final PDF updates automatically.

---

# Main Concepts

MathTeX Studio currently revolves around two complementary formats:

| Format | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.mtx` | Interactive mathematical scripting |
| `.mtex` | Executable LaTeX documents |

---

# `.mtx` — Mathematical Scripts

`.mtx` files are designed for:

- numerical experimentation
- reusable functions
- symbolic computation
- plotting
- linear algebra
- numerical methods
- quick calculations

The syntax is heavily inspired by MATLAB and Octave while remaining integrated with the MathTeX runtime.

Example:

```text
A = [1, 2; 3, 4];
b = [5; 6];

x = A | b;

print(x)
```

---

# `.mtex` — Executable Technical Documents

`.mtex` files combine LaTeX with executable code blocks.

This allows documents to:

- execute calculations during compilation
- inject computed values directly into the PDF
- generate plots automatically
- generate tables automatically
- keep documents synchronized with the underlying computation

Typical use cases:

- physics lab reports
- numerical methods assignments
- linear algebra reports
- scientific notes
- engineering documentation
- computational mathematics

---

# Example

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\section{Linear System}

\begin{code}
A = [1, 2; 3, 4];
b = [5; 6];

x = A | b;
\end{code}

The computed solution is:

\[
x = \var{x}
\]

\end{document}
```

Compilation pipeline:

```text
.mtex → execution → .tex → pdflatex → PDF
```

During compilation, MathTeX Studio:

1. executes the code blocks
2. stores variables in the runtime workspace
3. replaces placeholders such as `\var{x}`
4. generates an intermediate `.tex` file
5. compiles the final PDF automatically

---

# Variable and Expression Injection

## Variable Injection

```latex
\var{x}
```

Injects the value of a computed variable.

Supports indexing:

```latex
\var{A(2,1)}
```

---

## Expression Injection

```latex
\expr{\det(A)}
```

Evaluates and injects a computed expression.

Useful for:

- determinants
- norms
- traces
- symbolic expressions
- computed formulas

---

# Plot Generation

Plots can be generated programmatically and inserted directly into the document.

## Script

```text
f(x) = x.^2 - 2;

\plot(f, -1, 3, name = "graph")
```

## Document

```latex
\plot{graph}
```

---

# Tables

Generated tables can also be embedded automatically.

```latex
\table{results}
```

This is especially useful for:

- experimental measurements
- numerical iterations
- regression outputs
- matrix data

---

# Interactive Notebooks (`.mtn`)

MathTeX Studio also includes an experimental notebook system.

Notebook documents support:

- executable code blocks
- text blocks
- persistent shared workspace
- sequential execution
- output visualization
- export to `.mtex`

The notebook workflow is designed to combine ideas from:

- Jupyter
- MATLAB Live Scripts
- scientific computing notebooks

while remaining deeply integrated with the MathTeX document pipeline.

MathTeX Studio is not trying to replace:

- MATLAB
- Octave
- Wolfram Mathematica
- Jupyter
- Overleaf
- Python
- Julia

Instead, the goal is to combine parts of those workflows into a single environment focused on:

> executable mathematical documents

The project is especially oriented toward:

- students
- engineers
- researchers
- scientific computing workflows
- technical education

# Installation

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- `pdflatex` available in `PATH`
- dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- PyQt6 with QtPdf support

Recommended TeX distributions:

| Platform | Distribution |
|---|---|
| Windows | MiKTeX |
| Linux | TeX Live |
| macOS | MacTeX |

---

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blas1306/MathTeX_Studio.git
cd MathTeX_Studio
```

---

## Create a Virtual Environment

### Linux / macOS

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Running MathTeX Studio

## GUI Mode

```bash
python src/main.py
```

---

## CLI Mode

```bash
python src/main.py --cli
```

Behavior:

- the application attempts to launch the GUI first
- if GUI initialization fails, MathTeX falls back to CLI mode
- `--cli` forces text-only execution

---

# Build Artifacts

When compiling a `.mtex` document, build outputs are generated automatically.

Typical outputs:

```text
build/
├── document.tex
├── document.pdf
├── compile.log
└── document.mtextrace.json
```

The `.mtextrace.json` artifact is used for source mapping and synchronization between `.mtex` source lines and generated LaTeX.

---
